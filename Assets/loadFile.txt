:19
:20
-5,6
)Yes.
(Whatever.
-6,7
)Screw off.
(Whatever.
-7,8
)Sure, why not.
(That's the spirit. I was born in Gorkaria, hated my family so I moved to Fordal to see the kings and castles and all those grand things. I realized I had a nack for creating armor designs and became a merchant selling my art. I travelled here to show off my skills to The Protectors and they arrested me for who knows what. And now I'm here.

)They're the saviors that fight back the monsters.
(Are they really?
-10,11
)Why?
(Just making conversation.
-11,12

(Alright, then. Sorry for bothering you.

)Interesting story.
(Thank you. I wish it had more heroic deeds and life or death situations but I guess I just got lucky.
:41
-21,22
)I almost fell asleep.
(Well it certainly isn't the most action filled story... Still not interested in sharing?
:42
:43
-22,23
)You sell armor designs?
(Best in the nation! See my shirt? I designed this. My friend here helps me show my work to anyone who will buy it. Kings and queens have worn my designs!
:44
:45
-23,24
)Why did you hate your parents?
(They were a dull, unambitious couple. I admired them for their love for each other but not their willingness to sit and die. I wanted to see the world.

-32,33
)Is that why you came to The Protectors?
(Gods no. The Protectors can't protect anyone. They can only protect themselves. That's the only reason they build this place. They say they want to help people but yet they sit in their castle with all the poor orphans they captured and train them until their dieing breath to keep them safe from the world.
-33,34
)Why do you want to know?
(Just making conversation.
-34,35
)I think they're mean and arrogant.
(We are a lot alike you know. What if I told you we could free you from them.

)What's Fordal like?
(It was as magnificent as I had imagined! The colors were about as equally dull but the size of the structures and castles was breathtaking.
-44,45
